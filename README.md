# Decision-Theoretic-MAMS-trials-application-paper
Code and data for A Bayesian adaptive decision-theoretic approach can reduce the sample sizes of multi-arm exercise oncology trials 

PACES minimal is the minimal dataset
R Scripts named Functions... contain all required functions for the two different settings Pick-The-Winner or Pick-All-Treatments-Superior-To-Control
R Scripts named Script... contain R scripts to evaluate the designs on the PACES data (to evaluate sample size and final decisions) or on simulated datasets without all arms performing equal (to evaluate type I error)
Rdata files contain the stored results of the specific scripts
